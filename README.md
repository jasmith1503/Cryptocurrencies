## Overview
At a fictious company I will help Martha who is a senior manager for the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting, one of my most important clients. Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. I have been asked to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

Below is a 2D scatter plot which shows the group of a select group of Crypto tokens.
